# Assignment 1, Week 1

Create a raw text file from a document or book for example from the [Project Gutenberg page](http://www.gutenberg.org/) or some other online archive, corpus or text collection. Make sure that the text is not in HTML, or any binary format, but in raw text and UTF-8 encoded. Verify this by opening the text in Notepad or [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) on Windows, or in TextEdit on Macs.

Write a Python script that:

* Opens the text file and reads its content into memory
* Counts the number of vowels in the text, see ``strings`` and the ``count`` function, and prints out a statement with the number of vowels
* Splits the text into tokens (words), see ``strings`` and the ``split`` function, and prints out the number of tokens

Use the code examples in the GitHub src folder of project [Py3L](https://github.com/dcavar/Py3L).

Send the resulting code file to our email addresses:

``dcavar@umich.edu``

``mcavar@umich.edu``
